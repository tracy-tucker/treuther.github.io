<p>Am I a "Master Coder"? Nope, and I will not ever claim to be. I believe that coding is a continual journey of learning in an ever-changing world of programming and development. With that being said, I do enjoy the challenge, frustrations and moments of joy that come with communicating with a machine; which in turn allows us to create great things. Outside of code, I enjoy fitness training, reading a good book (a physical book in front of me), and traveling to unique unknown treasures in the U.S.</p>
