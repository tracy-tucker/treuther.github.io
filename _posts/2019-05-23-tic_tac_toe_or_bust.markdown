Who knew that a friendly little game of Tic Tac Toe could be so complicated? I grew up playing this game on fogged-up windows, on a napkin at a restaurant, chalk on a chalkboard, etc. I'm sure there are plenty, to this day, that still do the traditional form of the game.

But when you dig deeper into the simplicity and, let's say, actually code all the steps necessary to reveal 3 "X's" or "O's" in the proper position?... That's a different story altogether. Let's not talk about the physical act of placing the "X" or "O" in the desired position. Focus on just being able to convey the current status of the game. How would you tell a computer how to do that?

It may take some additional brain power to figure this out.
