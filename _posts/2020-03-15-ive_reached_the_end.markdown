<!-- I signed up for FlatIron School with the hopes of leaving and knowing so much more than I did when I started. Was I "introduced" to new languages and libraries? Yes. But, unfortunately with me working a full time job AND trying to do lessons 6-7 days a week... I feel more of a failure and my hopes of using what I learned outside of this program are pretty slim. I'm not trying to be negative or bring the program down. I just honestly don't know how other people do it working a full time job.

<!-- The only way I passed any of the projects was from watching the step-by-step instruct tutorials. I would understand it going along with the videos, but the moment I had to deter from the video and include my own improv code - complete disaster.

<!-- I saught help online via slack and got absolutely nothing in return. Well, a few times I would get a response but unfotunately it didn't lead to real help.

<!-- I met up with groups OUTSIDE of FlatIron in an effort to get additional help and actually received more help doing that than through the actual program. Granted, outside help was hit or miss because "outsiders" didn't understand why I had to follow certain guidelines.

<!-- The online instructors are stretched far too thin. The latter half of the program lacked big time on study groups, and when there were study groups they were not ideal for people who work a full time job.

<!-- I just can't believe I made it this far - to the end - and feel like I will not complete this. I've been stuck on the same terrible problem for a week. And even if I do finally finish this... I have zero confidence of using any of what I've learned, nor do I feel confident enough to even go through an interview.

I spent 5 years teaching myself code. 5 years! Learning what I could in the evenings, on my days off, trying to have a skill for myself for something better. I watched FlatIron for years, hoping one day I could afford to take the program, maybe quit my job to do it. And FINALLY! An online program! And another year went by and I finally decided to get out a loan to pay for it. And I'm a complete failure.

It was talked about at work that they would pay for the program and thank goodness they didn't! I wouldn't have been able to prove that I can take what I've learned and apply it at work. I'll just keep coding how I learned on my own. So. I guess I'll pay off my school loan and go back to my regular job and just be thankful I have a job.

Signing off...
